Well, hello, I am Charles Darwin. Almost 200 years ago, I sailed the world studying nature. I discovered the process of natural selection, which is the main way evolution happens. Choose a panel above to learn how species evolve.
#Darwin_L_Predator.ogg
Bummer! Your species did not have enough camouflage or long legs to avoid those hungry predators. Would you like to try again?
#Darwin_L_Cold.ogg
Too bad. Your TIES critters couldn’t stay warm enough to survive. Maybe thicker fur coats would have helped. Would you like to try again?
#Darwin_L_Heat.ogg
Too bad. Your TIES critters couldn't stay cool enough to survive. Maybe a larger surface area would have helped. Would you like to try again?
#Darwin_L_Disease.ogg
Oh no! Your species was wiped out by the spreading disease. Perhaps more variation would have helped. Would you like to try again?
#Darwin_L_HighFood.ogg
Unfortunately, your species wasn't tall enough to reach the food, so they starved. Would you like to try again?
#Darwin_L_Asteroid.ogg
Sadly, the asteroid's impact on the world's ecosystems were too severe for your TIES critters to survive. Would you like to try again?
#Darwin_L_Volcano.ogg
Sadly, the volcano's impact on the world's ecosystems were too severe for your TIES critters to survive. Would you like to try again?
#Darwin_Win.ogg
Yay!! Your species survived one million years! Hopefully, you learned something about natural selection along the way. Do you want to try again?
#Darwin_Volcano.ogg
Everybody run! A volcano is erupting. There is no time to use the Wheel of Mutations. Cross your fingers that some of your TIES critters have what it takes to survive.
#Darwin_Predators.ogg
Don’t look now but hungry predators have entered the territory. Remember, you can pause the game and try your luck on the Wheel of Mutations three times during your time travel.
#Darwin_Cold.ogg
Yikes, it’s cold! Some of the TIES critters may not be able to stay warm enough to survive this colder climate. Remember, you can pause the game and try your luck on the Wheel of Mutations three times during your time travel.
#Darwin_Heat.ogg
It sure is hot! It appears we are entering a period of global warming. Remember, you can pause the game and try your luck on the Wheel of Mutations three times during your time travel.
#Darwin_HighFood.ogg
Check out the delicious fruit trees sprouting in your territory. Are your TIES critters tall enough? Remember, you can pause the game and try your luck on the Wheel of Mutations three times during your time travel.
#Darwin_Disease.ogg
Oh no, a deadly virus is spreading in your population. There is no time to use the Wheel of Mutations. Cross your fingers that some of your TIES critters have what it takes to survive.
#Darwin_Asteroid.ogg
Mayday!! Mayday!! Your planet has been hit by an asteroid. This is what you call a cataclysmic event. There is definitely no time to use the Wheel of Mutations. Cross your fingers that some of your TIES critters have what it takes to survive.
#Darwin1.ogg
Welcome to the TIES Time Machine! The game is based on the rules of natural selection. Your species will have to survive a changing, often cruel, environment.
#Darwin2.ogg
Introducing the organism known as Tiesius critterus, or the TIES Critter. The population has many different traits (variation, yay!). You get to choose the traits of your starter population.
#Darwin3.ogg
Be careful choosing the traits of your starter population. Hint: Variation helps. Consider the possible changing environments your TIES Critters will face.
#Darwin4.ogg
Here we go. The goal of the TIES Time Machine is for your species to survive one million years. The individuals with the traits best suited to the changing environment will survive.
#Darwin5.ogg
You can spin the Wheel of Mutations three times during your time travel. Be careful: You do not know what you are going to get. Mutations are random.
